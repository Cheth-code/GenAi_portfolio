We will be using LangGraph. It’s a framework for building stateful, multi-step AI workflows with clear control over execution paths.

## 1 . Introduction: Why Do We Need Langchain

* Ever tried building a GenAI app and ended up with *“if-this-else-that”* chaos? Your AI codebase looks more like tangled earphones than a product roadmap.
    
* That’s where **LangGraph** comes in. It takes all that messy logic, puts it on a flowchart, and says: *“Relax, I’ll handle it.”*
    
* In this article, we’ll break down the problems LangGraph solves, what it is, and why it’s becoming a game-changer in the generative AI ecosystem.
    

## 2 . Problem Space: What’s broken?

LLMs are powerful, but…

* They don’t always get it right → you need retries.
    
* They can go in circles → you need loops.
    
* They may need different paths → you need conditional routing.
    
* You want to track *what happened when* → you need visibility.
    

## 3 . This is where LangGraph steps in:

* **LangGraph = Flow Orchestrator for LLM Apps.**
    
    It lets you design your AI workflow as a **graph**:
    
    * **Nodes** = steps (LLM call, DB query, validation, etc.)
        
    * **Edges** = transitions (what happens next).
        
    * Supports loops, branching, retries, and memory.
        
    
    Think of it as **React.js for your AI app’s logic**—modular, predictable, and easy to debug.
    

## 4 . THE CODE PART

### 1\. Define Your State

LangGraph uses typed state definitions to keep track of everything across steps.

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    user_query: str
    retries: int
    accuracy: float
```

### 2\. Build Your Graph

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

graph_builder.add_edge(START, "classify_query")
graph_builder.add_edge("classify_query", "handle_general")
graph_builder.add_edge("classify_query", "handle_code")
graph_builder.add_edge("handle_code", "validator")
graph_builder.add_edge("validator", "accuracy_check")
graph_builder.add_edge("accuracy_check", END)

graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

### 3\. Add logic functions

```python
def validator(state: State) -> State:
    # Check correctness of code output
    if state["accuracy"] < 90:
        state["retries"] += 1
    return state
```

### 4\. Run it

```python
initial_state = {"user_query": "write me Python code", "retries": 0, "accuracy": 85}
response = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(response)
```

## 5 . Conclusion

LangGraph is the **traffic controller for your AI agents**. It ensures they don’t crash into each other, don’t get lost, and reach the right destination—every single time.

As GenAI apps move from toys to production, **predictability &gt; magic**. LangGraph brings that predictability.

## 6 . Call to Action

💡 Next time you build with LangChain, don’t just stack functions. Sketch your workflow as a graph, let LangGraph do the heavy lifting, and enjoy cleaner, smarter, and more reliable AI apps.
