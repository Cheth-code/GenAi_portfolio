# 🚀 Generative AI

Welcome to my **Generative AI Portfolio** — a space where curiosity meets creation.  
Here I explore, learn, and build projects around Generative AI — from small experiments to evolving prototypes.  
This repo grows with me as I keep tinkering with new models, tools, and ideas.

## 📌 About

Generative AI is shaping how we create, think, and interact with technology.  
Through this repo, I’m documenting my journey of:

- Understanding the **core concepts** behind GenAI systems.  
- Building **hands-on projects** that connect theory to application.  
- Iterating and refining as I learn from both successes and mistakes.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **PDF_RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on PDFs for question answering. | LangChain, OpenAI API, FAISS |
| **PERSONA_AI_CHANAKYA** | Simulated persona of Acharya Chanakya — responses inspired by his philosophy. | LLMs, Prompt Engineering |
| **Prompt_Playground** | Sandbox for testing prompt structures and model behaviors. | Streamlit, OpenAI API |
| **VoiceGen_Prototype** | Early attempt at text-to-speech with expressive tuning. | TTS Models, Python |

*(New projects are added as I experiment further.)*

## 📚 Learnings & Experiments

- Explored **context length** limits and prompt chaining in RAG.  
- Studied **persona grounding** to make AI replies consistent with tone and character.  
- Played with **multimodal fusion** — combining text and vision models.  
- Iterated through **deployment basics** using Streamlit and simple REST APIs.

## 🔮 Roadmap

- [ ] Fine-tune small models for domain-specific outputs.  
- [ ] Build an interactive GenAI dashboard.  
- [ ] Explore text + audio co-generation.  
- [ ] Deploy projects for real-world demos.
