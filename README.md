# 🚀 Generative AI

Welcome to my **Generative AI Portfolio**!  
This repository is where I explore, learn, and build simple Generative AI projects.  
I’ll be updating it regularly as I grow and experiment with different models, tools, and ideas.

## 📌 About
Generative AI is one of the most exciting fields in AI today.  
Through this repo, I’m documenting my journey of:
- Learning the fundamentals of GenAI.
- Building small but meaningful projects.
- Improving them step by step as my knowledge grows.

## 🛠️ Projects
Here’s a list of projects I’ve worked on so far (will keep updating):

1. **PDF_RAG** → Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on PDFs for question-answering.  
2. **PERSONA_AI_CHANAKYA** → Persona_AI of Archarya Chanakaya, who thinks and answers like Chanakaya.

## 🔮 Roadmap
